Welcome to my personal blog! This is a small space where I record my thoughts, share knowledge, and explore the world. I have always believed that words are a bridge connecting oneself with others, and also the best carrier for accumulating growth. Therefore, I choose to use this blog as a window to organize my insights on technical practices, life reflections, and reading thoughts into articles. I hope to bring a little inspiration or resonance to every friend who visits here.  

This blog is built on the [AstroPaper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper) theme.

## About the Content
On this blog, you will find content in the following areas:
- **Technical Notes**: Records of practical experiences in front-end development and tool usage, such as troubleshooting tips for the Astro framework and efficient ways to use Tailwind CSS. I strive to break down technical difficulties in plain language.
- **Life Observations**: Shares small reflections from daily life—maybe insights from a trip, an in-depth reading of a good book, or a brief view on a social phenomenon, focusing on authenticity and sincerity.
- **Growth Reviews**: Regularly sorts out my study plans and goal achievement status. This not only serves as a motivation for myself but also hopes to provide references for friends who have similar confusions.
